### Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python


```python
#This a simple arithmetic expression to mutiply then add integers
(3*4)+5
```




    17




```python
#This will convert 200 minutes to hours by diving by 60
min=int(input("How Many Minutes Do You Have"))
hours=min//60
label=" Hours"
print("Total Rounded Hours=",hours, "hours")
```

    How Many Minutes Do You Have 200


    Total Rounded Hours= 3 hours
